"``discord.py`` offers a lower level aspect on interacting with Discord. "
"Often times, the library is used for the creation of bots. However this "
"task can be daunting and confusing to get correctly the first time. Many "
"times there comes a repetition in creating a bot command framework that "
"is extensible, flexible, and powerful. For this reason, ``discord.py`` "
"comes with an extension library that handles this for you."
