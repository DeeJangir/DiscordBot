.. currentmodule:: discord

API Reference
===============

The following section outlines the API of discord.py.

.. note::

    This module uses the Python logging module to log diagnostic and errors
    in an output independent way.  If the logging module is not configured,
    these logs will not be output anywhere.  See :ref:`logging_setup` for
    more information on how to set up and use the logging module with
    discord.py.

Version Related Info
---------------------

There are two main ways to query version information about the library.

.. data:: version_info

    A named tuple that is similar to `sys.version_info`_.

    Just like `sys.version_info`_ the valid values for ``releaselevel`` are
    'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate' and 'final'.

    .. _sys.version_info: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/sys.html#sys.version_info

.. data:: __version__

    A string representation of the version. e.g. ``'0.10.0-alpha0'``.

.. _discord-api-events:

Event Reference
---------------

This page outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

There are two ways to register an event, the first way is through the use of
:meth:`Client.event`. The second way is through subclassing :class:`Client` and
overriding the specific events. For example: ::

    import discord

    class MyClient(discord.Client):
        async def on_message(self, message):
            if message.author != self.user:
                return

            if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
                await message.channel.send('Hello World!')


If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to print a traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |corourl|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must be ``async def``
    functions.

.. function:: on_connect()

    Called when the client has successfully connected to Discord. This is not
    the same as the client being fully prepared, see :func:`on_ready` for that.

    The warnings on :func:`on_ready` also apply.

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Discord. Usually after login is successful
    and the :attr:`Client.guilds` and co. are filled up.

    .. warning::

        This function is not guaranteed to be the first event called.
        Likewise, this function is **not** guaranteed to only be called
        once. This library implements reconnection logic and thus will
        end up calling this event whenever a RESUME request fails.

.. function:: on_shard_ready(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_ready` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has become ready.

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that is ready.

.. function:: on_resumed()

    Called when the client has resumed a session.

.. function:: on_error(event, \*args, \*\*kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    printed to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    supress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception rasied and the exception itself can
    be retreived with a standard call to ``sys.exc_info()``.

    If you want exception to propogate out of the :class:`Client` class
    you can define an ``on_error`` handler consisting of a single empty
    ``raise`` statement.  Exceptions raised by ``on_error`` will not be
    handled in any way by :class:`Client`.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        execption.

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is received from the WebSocket, before
    it's processed. This event is always dispatched when a message is
    received and the passed data is not processed in any way.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param msg: The message passed in from the WebSocket library.
                Could be :class:`bytes` for a binary message or :class:`str`
                for a regular message.

.. function:: on_socket_raw_send(payload)

    Called whenever a send operation is done on the WebSocket before the
    message is sent. The passed parameter is the message that is being
    sent to the WebSocket.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param payload: The message that is about to be passed on to the
                    WebSocket library. It can be :class:`bytes` to denote a binary
                    message or :class:`str` to denote a regular text message.

.. function:: on_typing(channel, user, when)

    Called when someone begins typing a message.

    The ``channel`` parameter can be a :class:`abc.Messageable` instance.
    Which could either be :class:`TextChannel`, :class:`GroupChannel`, or
    :class:`DMChannel`.

    If the ``channel`` is a :class:`TextChannel` then the ``user`` parameter
    is a :class:`Member`, otherwise it is a :class:`User`.

    :param channel: The location where the typing originated from.
    :param user: The user that started typing.
    :param when: A ``datetime.datetime`` object representing when typing started.

.. function:: on_message(message)

    Called when a :class:`Message` is created and sent.

    .. warning::

        Your bot's own messages and private messages are sent through this
        event. This can lead cases of 'recursion' depending on how your bot was
        programmed. If you want the bot to not reply to itself, consider
        checking the user IDs. Note that :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` does not
        have this problem.

    :param message: A :class:`Message` of the current message.

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)

    Called when a message is deleted. If the message is not found in the
    :attr:`Client.messages` cache, then these events will not be called. This
    happens if the message is too old or the client is participating in high
    traffic guilds. To fix this, increase the ``max_messages`` option of
    :class:`Client`.

    :param message: A :class:`Message` of the deleted message.

.. function:: on_raw_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a message is deleted. Unlike :func:`on_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the message being in the internal message cache or not.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_bulk_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a bulk delete is triggered. This event is called regardless
    of the message IDs being in the internal message cache or not.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Message` receives an update event. If the message is not found
    in the :attr:`Client.messages` cache, then these events will not be called.
    This happens if the message is too old or the client is participating in high
    traffic guilds. To fix this, increase the ``max_messages`` option of :class:`Client`.

    The following non-exhaustive cases trigger this event:

    - A message has been pinned or unpinned.
    - The message content has been changed.
    - The message has received an embed.

        - For performance reasons, the embed server does not do this in a "consistent" manner.

    - A call message has received an update to its participants or ending time.

    :param before: A :class:`Message` of the previous version of the message.
    :param after: A :class:`Message` of the current version of the message.

.. function:: on_raw_message_edit(payload)

    Called when a message is edited. Unlike :func:`on_message_edit`, this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    Due to the inherently raw nature of this event, the data parameter coincides with
    the raw data given by the `gateway <https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#message-update>`_

    Since the data payload can be partial, care must be taken when accessing stuff in the dictionary.
    One example of a common case of partial data is when the ``'content'`` key is inaccessible. This
    denotes an "embed" only edit, which is an edit in which only the embeds are updated by the Discord
    embed server.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageUpdateEvent`

.. function:: on_reaction_add(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction added to it. Similar to on_message_edit,
    if the message is not found in the :attr:`Client.messages` cache, then this
    event will not be called.

    .. note::

        To get the :class:`Message` being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    :param reaction: A :class:`Reaction` showing the current state of the reaction.
    :param user: A :class:`User` or :class:`Member` of the user who added the reaction.

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_add(payload)

    Called when a message has a reaction added. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_add`, this is
    called regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawReactionActionEvent`

.. function:: on_reaction_remove(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction removed from it. Similar to on_message_edit,
    if the message is not found in the :attr:`Client.messages` cache, then this event
    will not be called.

    .. note::

        To get the message being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    :param reaction: A :class:`Reaction` showing the current state of the reaction.
    :param user: A :class:`User` or :class:`Member` of the user who removed the reaction.

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_remove(payload)

    Called when a reaction has a reaction removed. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_remove`, this is
    called regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawReactionActionEvent`

.. function:: on_reaction_clear(message, reactions)

    Called when a message has all its reactions removed from it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the :attr:`Client.messages` cache, then this event
    will not be called.

    :param message: The :class:`Message` that had its reactions cleared.
    :param reactions: A list of :class:`Reaction`\s that were removed.

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_clear(payload)

    Called when a message has all its reactions removed. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_clear`,
    this is called regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.

Async Iterator
----------------

Some API functions return an "async iterator". An async iterator is something that is
capable of being used in an `async for <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-async-for-statement>`_
statement.

These async iterators can be used as follows: ::

    async for elem in channel.history():
        # do stuff with elem here

Certain utilities make working with async iterators easier, detailed below.

.. class:: AsyncIterator

    Represents the "AsyncIterator" concept. Note that no such class exists,
    it is purely abstract.

    .. container:: operations

        .. describe:: async for x in y

            Iterates over the contents of the async iterator. Note
            that this is only available in Python 3.5 or higher.


    .. comethod:: next()

        |coro|

        Advances the iterator by one, if possible. If no more items are found
        then this raises :exc:`NoMoreItems`.

    .. comethod:: get(**attrs)

        |coro|

        Similar to :func:`utils.get` except run over the async iterator.

        Getting the last message by a user named 'Dave' or ``None``: ::

            msg = await channel.history().get(author__name='Dave')

    .. comethod:: find(predicate)

        |coro|

        Similar to :func:`utils.find` except run over the async iterator.

        Unlike :func:`utils.find`\, the predicate provided can be a
        coroutine.

        Getting the last audit log with a reason or ``None``: ::

            def predicate(event):
                return event.reason is not None

            event = await guild.audit_logs().find(predicate)

        :param predicate: The predicate to use. Can be a coroutine.
        :return: The first element that returns ``True`` for the predicate or ``None``.

    .. comethod:: flatten()

        |coro|

        Flattens the async iterator into a :class:`list` with all the elements.

        :return: A list of every element in the async iterator.
        :rtype: list

    .. method:: map(func)

        This is similar to the built-in :func:`map <python:map>` function. Another
        :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned that executes the function on
        every element it is iterating over. This function can either be a
        regular function or a coroutine.

        Creating a content iterator: ::

            def transform(message):
                return message.content

            async for content in channel.history().map(transform):
                message_length = len(content)

        :param func: The function to call on every element. Could be a coroutine.
        :return: An async iterator.

    .. method:: filter(predicate)

        This is similar to the built-in :func:`filter <python:filter>` function. Another
        :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned that filters over the original
        async iterator. This predicate can be a regular function or a coroutine.

        Getting messages by non-bot accounts: ::

            def predicate(message):
                return not message.author.bot

            async for elem in channel.history().filter(predicate):
                ...

        :param predicate: The predicate to call on every element. Could be a coroutine.
        :return: An async iterator.


Audit Log Data
----------------

Working with :meth:`Guild.audit_logs` is a complicated process with a lot of machinery
involved. The library attempts to make it easy to use and friendly. In order to accomplish
this goal, it must make use of a couple of data classes that aid in this goal.

.. autoclass:: AuditLogEntry
    :members:

.. class:: AuditLogChanges

    An audit log change set.

    .. attribute:: before

        The old value. The attribute has the type of :class:`AuditLogDiff`.

        Depending on the :class:`AuditLogActionCategory` retrieved by
        :attr:`~AuditLogEntry.category`\, the data retrieved by this
        attribute differs:

        +----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
        |                Category                |                    Description                    |
        +----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
        | :attr:`~AuditLogActionCategory.create` | All attributes are set to ``None``.               |
        +----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

.. class:: AuditLogDiff

    Represents an audit log "change" object. A change object has dynamic
    attributes that depend on the type of action being done. Certain actions
    map to certain attributes being set.

    Note that accessing an attribute that does not match the specified action
    will lead to an attribute error.

    To get a list of attributes that have been set, you can iterate over
    them. To see a list of all possible attributes that could be set based
    on the action being done, check the documentation for :class:`AuditLogAction`,
    otherwise check the documentation below for all attributes that are possible.

Webhook Support

Adapters allow you to change how the request should be handled. They all build on a single
interface, :meth:`WebhookAdapter.request`.

Abstract Base Classes
-----------------------

An abstract base class (also known as an ``abc``) is a class that models can inherit
to get their behaviour. The Python implementation of an `abc <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`_ is
slightly different in that you can register them at run-time. **Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated**.
They are mainly there for usage with ``isinstance`` and ``issubclass``\.

This library has a module related to abstract base classes, some of which are actually from the ``abc`` standard
module, others which are not.

.. _discord_api_models:

Discord Models
---------------

Models are classes that are received from Discord and are not meant to be created by
the user of the library.

.. danger::

    The classes listed below are **not intended to be created by users** and are also
    **read-only**.

    For example, this means that you should not make your own :class:`User` instances
    nor should you modify the :class:`User` instance yourself.

    If you want to get one of these model classes instances they'd have to be through
    the cache, and a common way of doing so is through the :func:`utils.find` function
    or attributes of model classes that you receive from the events specified in the
    :ref:`discord-api-events`.

.. note::

    Nearly all classes here have ``__slots__`` defined which means that it is
    impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

    More information about ``__slots__`` can be found
    `in the official python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots>`_.

Data Classes

Some classes are just there to be data containers, this lists them.

Unlike :ref:`models <discord_api_models>` you are allowed to create
these yourself, even if they can also be used to hold attributes.

Nearly all classes here have ``__slots__`` defined which means that it is
impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

The only exception to this rule is :class:`Object`, which is made with
dynamic attributes in mind.
